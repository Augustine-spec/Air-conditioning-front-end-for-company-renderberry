## Alternative: Use Video Instead

If you can't find a good GIF, I recommend using MP4 video:

**Free HVAC Videos:**
1. **Pexels**: https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/air%20conditioning/
2. **Pixabay**: https://pixabay.com/videos/search/hvac/
3. **Coverr**: https://coverr.co/search?q=cooling

**Then update HTML to:**
```html
<video class="hero-bg-animated" autoplay loop muted playsinline>
    <source src="hvac_hero_bg.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```

**And CSS to:**
```css
.hero-bg-animated {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
    z-index: 0;
    opacity: 0.8;
    filter: brightness(1.1) contrast(1.2);
}
```
