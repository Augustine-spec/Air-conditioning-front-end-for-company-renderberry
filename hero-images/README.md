# Hero Background Images Setup Guide

## Your 8 Uploaded Images Need to be Saved

You uploaded 8 images in the chat. To use them as background slideshow images, please follow these steps:

### Step 1: Save Your Uploaded Images

Right-click on each image you uploaded in the chat and save them to:
`c:\xampp\htdocs\Work  1\hero-images\`

### Step 2: Rename them as follows:

1. **Technician cleaning AC (city background)** → `img1.jpg`
2. **Two blue AHU units** → `img2.jpg`
3. **AHU components diagram** → `img3.jpg`
4. **FAHU with heat recovery wheel** → `img4.jpg`
5. **AC Services promotional image** → `img5.jpg`
6. **VRF multi-split system** → `img6.jpg`
7. **Single Split vs VRF comparison** → `img7.jpg`
8. **Ceiling cassette AC unit** → `img8.jpg`

### Step 3: Optimize Image Size (if needed)

If any image is larger than 1MB, use an online tool like:
- https://tinypng.com/
- https://compressor.io/
- https://imagecompressor.com/

Upload each image and download the compressed version (aim for under 500KB for best performance).

### Step 4: Verify

After saving all 8 images, your `hero-images` folder should contain:
- img1.jpg
- img2.jpg
- img3.jpg
- img4.jpg
- img5.jpg
- img6.jpg
- img7.jpg
- img8.jpg

### Step 5: Test

Open `index.html` in your browser and the slideshow should work automatically!

## Alternative: Use High-Quality Stock Images

If you prefer, I can update the code to use high-quality stock images from Unsplash that are similar to your uploaded images. Let me know!
